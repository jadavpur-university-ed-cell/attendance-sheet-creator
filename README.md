# Attendance Sheet Creator

This is an automated attendance sheet creator. You need to add the name of the sessions in the `session_titles` list. For each session, an individual excel sheet is created with names of random students from the `names.xlsx` file. Keep updating the file with more names. 

If for certain session, a single department name or year is required
